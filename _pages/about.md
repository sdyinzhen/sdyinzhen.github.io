Hello, welcome to visit my site! My name is David, and I'm a [Senior Research Scientist](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-zhen-yin?tab=bio) at Stanford's [Earth & Planetary Sciences Department](https://epsci.stanford.edu/). I am passionate about advancing new geological & geophysical knowledge for the global Mineral-Energy nexus. My work focuses on pioneering data-driven research and teaching to tackle decision-making challenges under subsurface uncertainty. I am particularly interested in integrating Human Intelligence (HI) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) when addressing the challenges, specifically in critical minerals, geo-energy resources, and carbon removal. 

I co-founded one of Stanford University’s largest industrial affiliates research programs, [Mineral-X](https://mineralx.stanford.edu/), and have been its Program Director since 2022. Stanford Mineral-X is now Silicon Valley’s major research center on critical mineral supplies, pioneering the transformation of the critical mineral sector using AI. I led the landing of over $4.35M in research funds, opening new research directions on exploration, mining, processing, and supply chains for critical minerals with cutting-edge AI technologies. 

Since 2024, I've been selected to serve on the National Academies’ Committee on “[Optimizing the USGS Mineral Resources Program Science Portfolio]( https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/optimizing-the-usgs-mineral-resources-program-science-portfolio),” addressing the national need for mineral resources data and science.
